    "\n",
    "The unit quality score $UQS(u)$ is computed as the average cosine similarity between all worker vectors for a given input media unit $u$, weighted by the worker quality ($WQS$) and annotation quality ($AQS$). The goal is to capture the degree of agreement in annotating the media unit. Through the weighted average, workers and annotations with lower quality will have less of an impact on the final score.\n",

    "### Weighted Cosine\n",

    "To weigh the metrics with the annotation quality, we compute $Wcos$, the weighted version of the cosine similarity. This metric is only applicable to closed tasks, where annotation quality can be calculated across media units.

    "\n",
    "The worker-media unit agreement $WUA(i)$ is the average cosine distance between the annotations of a worker $i$ and all annotations for the media units they have worked on, weighted by the media unit and annotation quality. It calculates how much a worker disagrees with the crowd on a media unit basis. Through the weighted average, media units and anntation with lower quality will have less of an impact on the final score.\n",

    "The worker-worker agreement $WWA(i)$ is the average cosine distance between the annotations of a worker $i$ and all other workers that have worked on the same media units as worker $i$, weighted by the worker and annotation qualities. The metric gives an indication as to whether there are consisently like-minded workers. This is useful for identifying communities of thought.

    "The annotation quality score $AQS(a)$ calculates the agreement of selecting an annotation $a$, over all the media units it appears in. Therefore, it is only applicable to closed tasks, where the same annotation set is used for all input media units.

    "## Media Unit-Annotation Score (UAS)\n",
    "\n",
    "The media unit - annotation score $UAS(u, a)$ calculates the likelihood that annotation $a$ is expressed in input media unit $u$. It is the ratio of the number of workers that picked annotation $u$ over all workers that annotated the unit, weighted by the worker quality.\n",
