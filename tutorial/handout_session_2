# Handout Session #2: Task Design & Building the Annotation Vector

Take one of the annotation tasks presented, or a task of your choice, and re-work the annotation vector, by doing one or several of the following:
Redesigning the annotation task by:
* Changing the type of the input unit (text vs. image vs. video)
* Changing the way the crowd annotations are collected (radio boxes, checkboxes, free text, other)
* Adding/removing components of the annotation vector
* Merging/clustering existing components of the annotation vector

How will these changes affect the annotation vector of your crowdsourcing task? Describe the outcome in terms of the trade-off between the degree of expressivity in crowd annotations and potential for ambiguity and disagreement.

Outcome: 1 slide presenting summary of ideas + 1 minute presentation
