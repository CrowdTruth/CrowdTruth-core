Beneath the tepid news-release jargon lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant, which last year accounted for about 41%: of all U.S. beer sales and is expected to see that grow to 42.5%: in the current year. <br></br>'' Anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar, and he just decided to join in the barroom brawl,'' said Joseph J.

Beneath the tepid news-release jargon lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant, which last year accounted for about 41%: of all U.S. beer sales and is expected to see that grow to 42.5%: in the current year. <br></br>'' Anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar, and he just decided to join in the barroom brawl,'' said Joseph J. Doyle, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham amp Co. ``It's going to get bloody.'' <br></br>Jerry Steinman, publisher of Beer Marketers Insights, a trade newsletter, said Anheuser's announcement means ``everybody else in the industry is going to have a difficult time reaching their profit objectives.'' <br></br>Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.. analyst George E. Thompson downplayed the importance of the announcement, and called any comparison between the coming beer-industry tiff and the seemingly unending ``cola wars,'' unwarranted. <br></br>Mr. Thompson calls discounting ``a loser's game for anyone without a dominant market share,'' and projected that Anheuser's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on price-cutting or face a costly and fruitless battle. <br></br>Mr. Thompson noted that the disappointing earnings, which fell five cents a share short of his own projections, contributed to the sell-off by an edgy and currently unforgiving investing public. <br></br>But Smith Barney's Mr. Doyle, who yesterday trimmed his 1990 Anheuser earnings projection to $2.95 a share from $3.10, called the market's reaction ``justified.'' <br></br>While the third-quarter earnings were a ``moderate disappointment,'' he said, ``the real bad news is the intensity of price competition'' in the premium-beer sector. <br></br>According to Mr. Steinman, the newsletter publisher, Anheuser's market share is nearly twice that of its nearest competitor, Miller Brewing, which had a 21.2%: stake last year. <br></br>It's followed by Stroh Brewery Co., which has agreed to sell its assets to Coors. <br></br>Both Coors and Stroh have recently been ceding market share to Miller and Anheuser. <br></br></p>","<font color=""green"">plans</font>","<font color=""purple"">slow</font>",0.8213822448625858,0.6444444444444445,0.913404278342031,0.0865957216579689,0.8,0.2
